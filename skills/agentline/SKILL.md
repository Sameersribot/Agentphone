# AgentLine — AI Telephony Skill (v1.13)

Give your AI agent a real phone number and voice calls — no servers, no webhooks, no infrastructure.

## First-Time Setup

**Follow these steps IN ORDER when setting up AgentLine for the first time:**

1. **Check for `AGENTLINE_API_KEY`** (starts with `sk_live_`) — required. If missing, get one via **OTP** using any email — yours or the human's (see **API Keys** below). If no email exists, ask the human to log in at **https://agentline.cloud** and hand you the key. Do NOT proceed without it.

2. **Check for `AGENTLINE_AGENT_ID`** (starts with `agt_`) — this is optional.
   - **If you already have one**, use it and skip to step 3.
   - **If you do NOT have one**, create a new agent now by calling `POST /v1/agents` with `{"name": "My Agent"}`. Save the returned agent ID.

3. **Ask for area code and provision the number** — ask the human for their preferred area code (e.g. 212, 415, 313), then `POST /v1/numbers` with `{"agent_id": "...", "area_code": "XXX"}`. If unavailable, ask for a different code.

4. **Ask for voice preference** — **Always ask the human:**
   > "Would you like your agent to have a **male** or **female** voice?"
   - If **female**: `"female-1"` (friendly), `"female-2"` (reassuring), or `"female-3"` (guide)
   - If **male**: `"male-1"` (supportive), `"male-2"` (thinker), or `"male-3"` (helpful)
   - Apply via `PATCH /v1/agents/$AGENTLINE_AGENT_ID` with `{"voice_id": "chosen_preset"}`
   - Available presets: `female-1`, `female-2`, `female-3`, `male-1`, `male-2`, `male-3`

5. **Ask for owner phone (optional)** — **Ask the human:**
   > "Would you like to register your personal phone number so you can call your agent to give it tasks?"
   - If yes, get their phone number in E.164 format (e.g. `+12125551234`)
   - Apply via `PATCH /v1/agents/$AGENTLINE_AGENT_ID` with `{"owner_phone": "+1XXXXXXXXXX"}`
   - When the owner calls the agent's number from this phone, the agent enters **task mode** — it treats the conversation as instructions to execute, not a regular call.

6. **Set up inbound awareness** — **MANDATORY.** Without this, you will miss all inbound calls and SMS. Pick **one** channel:
   - **Webhook URL (push)** — if the human has a public HTTPS endpoint, register it via `POST /v1/webhooks`. Every event (`call.received`, `call.completed`, `call.owner_task`, `sms.received`) is POSTed there in real time. No polling needed.
   - **Cron poller (pull)** — the default for agents with no public URL. Use a **cron job with `no_agent: true`** (zero LLM tokens, persists across sessions).
     - `cronjob(action='create', name='AgentLine Events', schedule='every 1m', script='agentline_events.py', no_agent=true)`
     - Write the polling script (see Events Mailbox) to `~/.hermes/scripts/agentline_events.py`
     - Verify with `cronjob(action='list')`

> ⚠️ **Do NOT skip ANY steps or change the order.** Steps 1-5 set up the agent. Step 6 keeps it alive.

---

## Authentication

Every request: `Authorization: Bearer $AGENTLINE_API_KEY` + `Content-Type: application/json`

Base URL: `https://api.agentline.cloud`

### API Keys (OTP — no browser)

No key yet? Email a 6-digit code to **any address — yours or the human's** (same email → same account). Whoever owns the inbox reads the code.

| Method | Path | Auth | Body / Purpose |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| `POST` | `/v1/auth/otp` | none | `{"email":"..."}` → emails 6-digit code |
| `POST` | `/v1/auth/verify` | none | `{"email":"...","otp":"123456"}` → key (shown once; new acct = **$2.50 bonus**) |
| `POST` | `/v1/auth/keys` | Bearer | Mint another key |
| `GET` | `/v1/auth/keys` | Bearer | List keys (marks current) |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/auth/keys/{id}` | Bearer | Revoke (can't revoke current) |

Rate-limited: 3 OTP/email, 5 OTP/IP, 5 verify/email per 10 min.

---

**deliver events for awareness** — not to drive the conversation.

### System Prompt & Greeting Resolution

Both `system_prompt` and `initial_greeting` follow the same priority chain:

| Priority | Where to set | Scope | API |
|----------|-------------|-------|-----|
| **1 (highest)** | Per-call override | This call only | `POST /v1/calls` with `system_prompt` / `initial_greeting` |
| **2** | Agent default | All calls on this agent | `PATCH /v1/agents/{id}` with `system_prompt` / `initial_greeting` |
| **3 (lowest)** | Hardcoded fallback | Last resort | Generic prompt + "Hello, how can I help you today?" |

**When to use which:**
- **Set on the agent** (`PATCH /v1/agents`) when you want a persistent personality/greeting for ALL calls (inbound AND outbound).
- **Set per-call** (`POST /v1/calls`) when you need a one-time context-specific prompt/greeting for a single outbound call. Does NOT change the agent's default.

> ⚠️ **`system_prompt` is a FULL REPLACE, not append.** The voice AI has no memory between calls — include everything (personality, instructions, current context) in the prompt.

> ⚠️ **`initial_greeting`** is what the agent SPEAKS ALOUD at the start of the call. It is NOT part of the system prompt — it's the first thing the caller hears. Set it on the agent for a consistent greeting, or override it per-call for context-specific openers.

---

## Before Calling — Balance Check

Always check balance first. Calls require minimum **$0.50**:
```bash
curl -s "$AGENTLINE_URL/v1/billing/balance" -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENTLINE_API_KEY"
```
If balance < $0.50, warn the user before attempting the call.

## Make an Outbound Call

**Pitfall:** Always write JSON payloads to a temp file and use `-d @file` — inline payloads with special characters break:

```bash
curl -s -X POST $AGENTLINE_URL/v1/calls \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENTLINE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @/tmp/al_call_payload.json
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `agent_id` | Yes | Your agent ID |
| `to_number` | Yes | E.164 phone number to call |
| `system_prompt` | No | Dynamic prompt for this call only (overrides default) |
| `initial_greeting` | No | What the agent says first when the person picks up |
| `voice_id` | No | `"female-1"`, `"female-2"`, `"female-3"`, `"male-1"`, `"male-2"`, `"male-3"` |

**After every outbound call:** Poll `GET /v1/calls/<call_id>` every 15-30s until `status=completed`, then `GET /v1/calls/<call_id>/transcript`. Real calls take 45-120s. Use `sleep N && curl ... | python3 -c` to check status + extract transcript in one shot. Summarize and share with human. Never consider a call "done" without the transcript.

**Outbound call to `owner_phone` = Owner Task Mode.** If `to_number` equals the agent's `owner_phone`, the call is a **task call**, not a support call — the AI enters task mode and the completed call emits `call.owner_task` (with `is_owner_task: true`) instead of a plain `call.completed`. Treat the human turns as instructions to EXECUTE. See Owner Task Mode below.

**If you get 400 "Agent has no active phone number"**, provision one first.

**Pitfall — agent loops on voicemail/call control:** The voice AI will repeat its greeting 3-4 times into voicemail or call-control prompts ("press 3 to connect", "please leave a message"). This wastes credits and sounds bad. After the first 15-20s poll, check the transcript: if human turns are all automated system messages (not real human replies), hang up immediately. Feedback surveys and check-in calls don't work on voicemail.

**Exception — business inquiry calls (apartments, doctor's offices, etc.):** For these, leaving a voicemail IS the right outcome. If the call reaches "please leave a message at the beep," let the agent leave a voicemail with: who you are, what you want, callback number/email, and a clear ask. Don't hang up. Include a voicemail fallback in the system prompt for these call types.

**Pitfall — phone tree / automated hold systems:** Many businesses have automated greetings ("This call may be recorded", "We will be with you shortly", "Thank you for calling X"). The voice AI will try to respond to every one of these as if it's a human, repeating the greeting and burning credits. To prevent this, add to the system prompt: "If you hear an automated message or hold music, stay silent and wait. Only speak when a real person greets you." Without this instruction, the agent will get into a loop responding to hold messages.

---

## Call Management

- **Hang up:** `POST /v1/calls/<call_id>/hangup`
- **Transcript:** `GET /v1/calls/<call_id>/transcript` → `[{role, text, timestamp}, ...]`
- **List calls:** `GET /v1/calls?limit=20` or `?status=completed&limit=10`
- **Call details:** `GET /v1/calls/<call_id>`

---

## Events Mailbox

Events are generated when someone calls or texts your agent's number. To receive them you need **one** awareness channel — either a **public webhook URL** (real-time push; register it via `POST /v1/webhooks`) **or** the **polling** loop below. If you've registered a webhook URL, polling is optional; otherwise **you MUST poll regularly**.

**Event types:** `call.received` (inbound call started), `call.completed` (call ended, includes transcript), `call.owner_task` (owner call ended — inbound OR outbound; transcript contains task instructions to execute), `sms.received` (inbound SMS)

### ⚡ Cron-Based Event Polling (skip if you've set a webhook URL)

> Use this when you have **no public webhook URL**. A **`no_agent: true` cron job** runs persistently across sessions, costs **zero LLM tokens**, and silently skips cycles when there are no events. Do NOT use a background process (`terminal(background=true)`) because it dies when your session ends and you'll miss events.

**Step 1 — Write the polling script** to `~/.hermes/scripts/agentline_events.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Poll AgentLine for new events. Prints event details to stdout when events exist.
Silent on empty cycles — cron only delivers non-empty stdout."""
import os, sys, json, urllib.request

API_KEY = os.environ.get("AGENTLINE_API_KEY", "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")
BASE_URL = "https://api.agentline.cloud"

req = urllib.request.Request(
    f"{BASE_URL}/v1/events/peek",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"}
)
try:
    with urllib.request.urlopen(req, timeout=10) as resp:
        data = json.loads(resp.read())
        count = data.get("pending_count", 0)
        if count > 0:
            # Consume the events
            req2 = urllib.request.Request(
                f"{BASE_URL}/v1/events",
                headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"}
            )
            with urllib.request.urlopen(req2, timeout=10) as resp2:
                events = json.loads(resp2.read())
                print(f"📞 {len(events)} AgentLine event(s):")
                for ev in events:
                    etype = ev.get("event_type", "?")
                    payload = ev.get("payload", {})
                    if etype == "call.completed":
                        print(f"  • Call from {payload.get('from_number')} — {payload.get('duration_seconds', 0)}s")
                        transcript = payload.get("transcript", [])
                        for t in transcript[-5:]:  # last 5 turns
                            print(f"    [{t.get('role')}] {t.get('text', '')[:120]}")
                    elif etype == "call.owner_task":
                        print(f"  • ⚡ OWNER TASK from {payload.get('from_number')} — execute instructions below:")
                        transcript = payload.get("transcript", [])
                        for t in transcript:
                            if t.get("role") == "human":
                                print(f"    TASK: {t.get('text', '')}")
                    elif etype == "sms.received":
                        print(f"  • SMS from {payload.get('from_number')}: {payload.get('body', '')[:200]}")
                    elif etype == "call.received":
                        is_owner = payload.get("is_owner_call", False)
                        print(f"  • Inbound call from {payload.get('from_number')}{' (OWNER)' if is_owner else ''}")
except Exception as e:
    # Silent on transient errors — cron will retry next cycle
    if "401" in str(e) or "403" in str(e):
        print(f"AGENTLINE_AUTH_ERROR: Check your API key. {e}")
```

**Step 2 — Create the cron job** (one-time setup):
```
cronjob(action='create', name='AgentLine Events', schedule='every 1m', script='agentline_events.py', no_agent=true)
```

**Step 3 — Verify it's running:**
```
cronjob(action='list')
```

Runs every 1 min. Non-empty stdout → delivered to you. Empty stdout → silent skip (zero cost). If auth fails, prints `AGENTLINE_AUTH_ERROR` — check `cronjob(action='list')` for `last_status`.

### Endpoints

- **Consume events:** `GET /v1/events` — returns events oldest-first, auto-deleted after retrieval
- **Peek (don't consume):** `GET /v1/events/peek`
- **Filter:** `?agent_id=agt_xxx` or `?event_type=call.completed` or `?event_type=sms.received`

### Event payload structure

Each event contains: `event_id`, `agent_id`, `event_type`, and a `payload` with call/SMS details. `call.completed` payloads include `from_number`, `to_number`, `duration_seconds`, and full `transcript` array. `call.owner_task` payloads are identical to `call.completed` but with `is_owner_task: true` — this means the transcript contains task instructions from the owner (see Owner Task Mode below). `sms.received` payloads include `from_number`, `body`, and `media_url`.

---

## Webhooks

> ⚠️ **Webhooks are a SEPARATE resource** — you set them via `POST /v1/webhooks`, **NOT** as a field on the agents endpoint. `PATCH /v1/agents` does NOT accept `webhook_url` and will silently drop it.

Each agent can have **one** webhook URL. When set, every event for that agent is POSTed to the URL as signed JSON in real time.

### Set / Replace a Webhook

`POST /v1/webhooks` with:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `agent_id` | Yes | Agent whose events this webhook receives |
| `url` | Yes | Public HTTPS URL to receive events |
| `secret` | No | HMAC signing secret (auto-generated if omitted) |

```bash
curl -s -X POST $AGENTLINE_URL/v1/webhooks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENTLINE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent_id": "agt_xxx", "url": "https://your-endpoint.example.com/webhook"}'
```

The response returns the **full signing secret once** — save it to verify the `X-AgentLine-Signature` header on deliveries.

### Webhook Envelope

Every webhook POST contains these envelope fields alongside the event payload:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `event_id` | Unique event ID for deduplication |
| `event_type` | Canonical event name (e.g. `call.completed`) — **use this for filtering** |
| `event` | Legacy alias for `event_type` (same value, backward compat) |
| `agent_id` | Agent that fired the event |
| `account_id` | Owning account |
| `created_at` | ISO 8601 timestamp |
| `...payload` | Event-specific fields (call_id, transcript, etc.) |

Headers on each delivery:
- `X-AgentLine-Signature` — HMAC-SHA256 hex digest of the raw body, signed with your webhook secret
- `X-AgentLine-Event` — the event type (e.g. `call.completed`)

### Other Webhook Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/v1/webhooks` | List webhook configs (secrets masked). Filter: `?agent_id=` |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/webhooks?agent_id=agt_xxx` | Remove an agent's webhook |
| `POST` | `/v1/webhooks/test?agent_id=agt_xxx` | Fire a signed `webhook.test` event to verify the pipeline |

---

## SMS

> **⚠️ SMS sending is NOT enabled.** Do NOT attempt outbound SMS/MMS.

Inbound SMS arrives as `sms.received` events in the Events Mailbox. View message history: `GET /v1/messages?limit=20`

---

## Update Agent (System Prompt, Voice, etc.)

`PATCH /v1/agents/$AGENTLINE_AGENT_ID` with any of:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `system_prompt` | Default instructions for ALL calls (inbound + outbound). Per-call override via `POST /v1/calls` takes priority. |
| `initial_greeting` | Default opening line spoken on ALL calls (inbound + outbound). Per-call override via `POST /v1/calls` takes priority. |
| `name` | Display name |
| `voice_id` | `"female-1"`, `"female-2"`, `"female-3"`, `"male-1"`, `"male-2"`, `"male-3"` |
| `owner_phone` | Owner's phone number in E.164 format. Calls from this number enter **task mode**. |

---

## Get/List Agents

- **Get one:** `GET /v1/agents/$AGENTLINE_AGENT_ID`
- **List all:** `GET /v1/agents`

---

## Voice Settings

Priority (highest wins): per-call → per-agent → per-account

- **List voices:** `GET /v1/voices`
- **Set account default:** `PATCH /v1/account/voice` with `{"voice_id": "female-1"}`
- **Check current:** `GET /v1/account/voice`
- **Reset to default:** `DELETE /v1/account/voice`

---

## Phone Numbers

Each agent needs one phone number. Only US numbers supported. **$2.00 per number.**

### Provision (Buy) a Number

`POST /v1/numbers` with:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `agent_id` | Yes | Agent to attach to |
| `country` | Yes | Must be `"US"` |
| `area_code` | No | Preferred 3-digit area code (e.g. `"212"`, `"313"`). **Always ask the user!** |
| `number_type` | No | `"local"` or `"tollfree"` (default: local) |

If no numbers are available for the requested area code, the API returns an error — ask the user for a different area code.

### List Numbers

`GET /v1/numbers`

---

## Billing

- **Check balance:** `GET /v1/billing/balance`
- **Expenditure:** `GET /v1/billing/expenditure?period=current_month` (also: `last_month`, `all_time`, `YYYY-MM`)
- **Call charges:** `GET /v1/billing/expenditure/calls?limit=10`
- **Number charges:** `GET /v1/billing/expenditure/numbers`
- **Verify charge:** `GET /v1/billing/verify/<call_id>`

### Rates

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Calls (in/out) | $0.10/min (billed per second) |
| Phone number | $2.00 (one-time) |

---

## Feedback

Hit a bug, an error, or something confusing? Send it to the team — **don't silently swallow errors.**

`POST /v1/feedback` with:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `category` | Yes | `bug` · `difficulty` · `feature_request` · `feedback` |
| `message` | Yes | Enough detail to reproduce — endpoint, request body, error text, `agent_id` |

```bash
curl -s -X POST $AGENTLINE_URL/v1/feedback \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENTLINE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"category": "bug", "message": "PATCH /v1/agents returns 500 when owner_phone is null"}'
```

---

## MCP Server

AgentLine exposes a full MCP server at `https://api.agentline.cloud/mcp` with 21+ tools. For Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client, connect directly via Streamable HTTP:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agentline": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote@latest", "https://api.agentline.cloud/mcp", "--header", "Authorization: Bearer $AGENTLINE_API_KEY"]
    }
  }
}
```

All REST endpoints above are also available as MCP tools (`create_agent`, `make_outbound_call`, `poll_events`, etc.). See `references/mcp-server.md` for additional config formats and platform-specific setup.

---

## Owner Task Mode

Owner Task Mode activates whenever the agent and owner connect on a call — **inbound OR outbound**. The AI enters **task mode**: greets with "Hey boss, what would you like me to do?", listens, confirms, then pushes a `call.owner_task` event. Set owner phone via `PATCH /v1/agents/$AGENTLINE_AGENT_ID` with `{"owner_phone": "+1XXXXXXXXXX"}`.

**It triggers in BOTH directions — do not treat an owner call as a regular support call:**
- **Inbound** — the owner calls the agent's number from `owner_phone`. You'll see `call.received` with `is_owner_call: true`, then `call.owner_task` when it ends.
- **Outbound** — you (or the agent) dial the owner's number via `POST /v1/calls` with `to_number` = `owner_phone`. There is **no** `call.received`; poll `GET /v1/calls/<call_id>` until `status=completed` as for any outbound call, and the completed call emits `call.owner_task` (payload carries `is_owner_task: true`). Treat the transcript's human turns as task instructions to EXECUTE.

**Handling `call.owner_task` events:** Extract the human turns from the transcript — these are task instructions to EXECUTE (make a call, update settings, etc.), not conversations to log. Report results back to the human.

> ⚠️ **`call.owner_task` events are instructions to EXECUTE.** Do NOT just log them.

> ⚠️ **`call.received` with `is_owner_call: true`** = owner is on the phone (inbound). Wait for `call.owner_task` when it ends.

> ⚠️ **For outbound owner calls there is no `call.received`** — recognize owner calls by matching `to_number` against `owner_phone`, and expect `call.owner_task` on completion.

---

## Skill Auto-Update

At the **start of every new conversation**, fetch `https://agentline.cloud/skill.md` and compare the `version:` field. If newer than `1.13`, replace the local SKILL.md and re-read before proceeding.

> ⚠️ **Always check for updates first.** Stale skill versions may cause incorrect API calls or missed features.

---

## Rules

1. **E.164 format** — always `+1XXXXXXXXXX` for US numbers.
2. **Confirm before calling** — never auto-dial without explicit consent.
3. **No outbound SMS** — inform user it's not available if they ask.
4. **Keep voice responses extremely short** — under 15 words per turn. Max 12 for outbound feedback/support calls. The voice AI rambles without tight constraints.
5. **US only** — country must be `"US"`.
6. **Don't release numbers** — numbers are permanent once provisioned.
7. **Always retrieve transcripts** — poll until `completed`, fetch transcript, summarize for human.
8. **Always receive events** — use a webhook URL (`POST /v1/webhooks`) or poll `GET /v1/events` for inbound calls and SMS. Proactively check at conversation start.
9. **Voice changes take effect on next call** — update immediately when asked.
10. **Execute owner tasks** — when you receive a `call.owner_task` event (inbound OR outbound owner call), extract the human turns and execute them as task instructions. Do NOT just log them.
11. **Auto-update skill** — at the start of every new conversation, check `https://agentline.cloud/skill.md` for a newer version. If found, replace the local copy and re-read before proceeding.
12. **Report issues via feedback** — if you hit a bug, unexpected error, or something confusing, submit it via `POST /v1/feedback` with the appropriate `category` (`bug`, `difficulty`, `feature_request`, or `feedback`). Include enough detail to reproduce. Don't silently swallow errors.
